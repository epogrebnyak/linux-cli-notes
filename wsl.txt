From DOS to Linux
=================

Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)
--------------------------------

- WSL is a great way to have working Linux shell on Windows, 
  [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
- `wsl | ubuntu | bash` are equally good to call WSL
- [wslconfig.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config) 
  helps configuring multiple linux distrubutions on Windows
  

Terminals 
---------

- my usual terminal is [cmder](http://cmder.net)
- [hyper](https://hyper.is) seems a nicely colored terminal
- reading about [terminology](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con)

Prompt
------

- prompt is whatever shell types for you as a welcome message
- `echo $PS1` shows your prompt configuration
- you can change the prompt by setting `$PS1` with `export`:
  - bare minimum `export PS1="$ "` 
  - time, date, current folder, newline and `$` `export PS1="\D{%Y-%m-%d} \A \w\n\$ "`
- `~/.bashrc` file holds your default `$PS1` configuarion, `. ~/.bashrc` reloads this 
  configuration

Get better advice: cheat and cheat.sh
-------------------------------------

- `man` is lengthy and notorious to read
- `cheat` is nifty
- `cheat.sh`  is fun and fast

After installing WSL and pip3 `site-packages` folder not on path 
----------------------------------------------------------------

- install WSL - Ubuntu 18.04 
- now I want examples from python package *cheat* to explore linux 
  (but the story would be the same for any package)
- `sudo apt-get update` (because `sudo apt-get install pip3` will not work
   of fresh installation)
- `sudo apt-get install pip3`
- `sudo pip install cheat`
- `cheat` not recognised as a command, while `python3` runs fine from
  /usr/bin/python3
- realise `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages` must be on path 
- in `~/.profile` add `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages` to path 
  with `export PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages:PATH"`
